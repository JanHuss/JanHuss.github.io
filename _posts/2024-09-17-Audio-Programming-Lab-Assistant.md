I had been given the opportunity by the module lead to help out in the Audio Programming Lab sessions on campus. This involves, walking around the class room, checking in on the students if they are in need of assistance and to help them out to resolve their inquiries.
Given my knowledge and previous history in the music industry I have solid foundations in Digital Signal Processing. Despite also taking the module as a student, this knowledge gives me the advantage in understanding the lab work and lectures faster and an opportunity to test my knowledge while explaining it to the individual students.
