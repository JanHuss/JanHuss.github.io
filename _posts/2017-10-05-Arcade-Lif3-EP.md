For my final course assignment during my time at the Manchester MIDI School (now School of Electronic Music), I was given free reign as to what I would like to compose. I thought it would be nice to create an EP consisting of 3 tracks. I really enjoy chip tune but also enjoy club music such as dubstep drum and bass and progressive house. Therefore, the idea was to make 3 club tunes, infused with chiptune.
The project involved composing, sound design, sound engineering, mixing and mastering.
I was so excited that I ended up releasing the Arcade Lif<3 EP and Zombie Run single on all major streaming platforms.
