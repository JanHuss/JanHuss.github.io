# Introduction

For my final course assignment at the **Manchester MIDI School** (now the **[School of Electronic Music](https://schoolofelectronicmusic.com/)**), I had complete creative freedom over what I wanted to compose. Instead of a single track, I decided to challenge myself by creating a **three-track EP** that blended my love for **chiptune** with **EDM** genres like **dubstep**, **drum & bass**, and **progressive house**.

# Project Breakdown

The **Arcade Lif<3 EP** was a deep dive into:

- **Composition** â€“ Structuring each track with a balance of retro and modern elements.
- **Sound Design** â€“ Crafting chiptune-inspired synths and blending them with EDM-style bass and drums.
- **Sound Engineering** â€“ Ensuring each track had punch and clarity.
- **Mixing & Mastering** â€“ Refining the final sound for professional release.

# Challenges & Lessons Learned

The biggest challenge was **merging two distinct styles** â€” keeping the nostalgic charm of **chiptune** while maintaining the energy and flow of **EDM**. I experimented with different **synth textures, sidechain techniques, and rhythmic structures** to make everything sit together naturally.

# Beyond the Assignment

I was so excited about the results that I decided to **officially release the Arcade Lif<3 EP**, along with my single *[Zombie Run](http://localhost:4000/posts/Zombie-Run/)*, on all major streaming platforms. What started as a course project became a **published body of work** that showcases my passion for electronic music.

# Final Thoughts

This project was a defining moment for me as a producer, solidifying my love for **genre fusion and creative sound design**. If you're curious about how chiptune meets EDM, **hit play and check it out above!**
