# Introduction

*Oh, Wrong Number!* was the result of our first-ever **48-hour GMTK Game Jam** in **2022**. 
The theme was "**The Roll of the Dice**", and for my teammate and me, this project became a 
**major milestone**.

We had never attempted a **game jam** before, but we were eager to challenge ourselves. However, 
things quickly took a turn when the musician we had planned to work with **dropped out almost 
immediately**. Instead of giving up, we **refactored our approach on the spot** and adapted to 
the situation.

# The Development Process

With just 48 hours to make a game, we divided our roles:

- My teammate focused on visuals.
- I took charge of the audio.
- We both worked on **Unity & C#**, implementing assets and game mechanics.

Beyond just **art and sound**, our main goal was simple:
- **Finish a small, playable game.**
- **Feel the satisfaction of completing a jam.**
- **Most importantly, have fun.**

We succeeded in all three‚Äîbut what surprised us the most was **how well the game was received**. 
Seeing **so many players enjoy our first completed and published game** was beyond rewarding.

# Lessons Learned

This jam taught me a lot in just 48 hours:

- **Game production & fast iteration** under tight deadlines.
- **Writing C# code and working with Unity‚Äôs engine.**
- **The power of teamwork** ‚Äî my teammate and I worked together incredibly well.
  
# Final Thoughts

What started as a **small challenge** became a **huge milestone**. _Oh, Wrong Number!_ wasn‚Äôt 
just our **first game jam entry** ‚Äî it was the **first completed game we ever released**. 
The experience gave me confidence in **game development, programming, and creative 
problem-solving**, setting the stage for future projects.

**Try it out and see how it plays!**
