Oh, Wrong Number! is the result of the 48 hour GMTK Game Jam 2022.
The prompt was "The roll of the dice". This project was a major milestone for the both of us. Never had we attempted a game jam before. However, after being abandoned by the musician almost instantly, we decided to try and complete non the less.
We refactored our approach almost instantly by having my team mate work on visuals and myself on audio, while we both worked on Unity and C# to implement the assets and game mechanics.
Art and audio aside, our goal was to complete a small game, to feel the satisfaction from it and to have fun while doing so. While we ticked all of these boxes, we were also amazed as to how many people enjoyed our first completed and published game.
I learned a lot from these 48 hours in terms of production, code, the Unity engine and that my team mate and I worked incredibly well together as a team.
