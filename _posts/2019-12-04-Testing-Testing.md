# Introduction

As part of an **online module at [Point Blank Music School](https://www.pointblankmusicschool.com/)**, 
I was given a unique challenge â€” **produce three different tracks using three distinct approaches**. 
The goal was to **expand my versatility as a producer** by experimenting with different production 
methods.

# The Three Approaches

For this project, I created:

- **A Hip-Hop Track** â€“ Built entirely from **samples**, pushing my creativity in manipulation 
  and layering.
- **An Ambient Track** â€“ Focused on **self-created sounds**, stretching them to their full 
  expressive potential.
- **A Dubstep Track** â€“ Designed entirely through **sound design**, crafting everything from the 
  ground up.

# Key Takeaways & Challenges

While each track presented its own set of challenges, I **learned the most from the hip-hop and 
ambient tracks**:

- **Sample Manipulation** â€“ Before this project, I had never explored the depth of **creative 
  sampling** to this extent. It opened up a whole new way of thinking about sound.
- **Sonic Experimentation** â€“ The ambient track pushed me to **reshape and manipulate my own 
  recordings**, reinforcing my understanding of textures and dynamics.

# Final Thoughts

This project was an invaluable exercise in diverse production techniques. It reinforced the idea 
that **different genres demand different workflows**, and each approach added something new to my 
skillset.
