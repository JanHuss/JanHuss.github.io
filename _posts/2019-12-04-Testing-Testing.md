During an online module at Point Blank Music School, I was tasked with producing three different tracks using three different approaches. I chose to produce a hip hop track fully based on samples, an ambient track in which I pulled self created sounds to their maximum and a dubstep track fully based on sound design.
I learned a lot mostly from the ambient and hip-hop tracks. Manipulating samples the way I did were prior to this project unknown to me.
Music Production, sound design, mix and master were accomplished by myself
