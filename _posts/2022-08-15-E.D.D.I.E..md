# Introduction

_E.D.D.I.E_ holds a **special place in my heart**. After the success of _[Oh, Wrong Number!](https://janhuss.github.io/posts/Oh,-Wrong-Number!/)_, 
we decided to take on **one more game jam before university started again**. This time, we entered
the **Wowie Game Jam 2022**, another **48-hour challenge**, where the theme was 
**"Collaborate with AI."**

At the time, we had yet to explore the **vast world of AI**, so we decided to put our own spin on 
the theme. Instead of coding an advanced AI system, we built a game where a **small robot, 
E.D.D.I.E., is unable to react to its surroundings**. The player must **help him reach the finish 
line** using the provided items.

We thought this was a **unique take** ‚Äî until a friend pointed out that we had essentially created 
**Lemmings**. Funnily enough, we unknowingly **developed a similar game in the same city where 
Lemmings was originally made, Dundee!**

# My Contributions to the Project

For _E.D.D.I.E._, I was responsible for:

- **Composing the music & designing the SFX.**
- **Implementing all audio into FMOD.**
- **Coding some of the core mechanics.**

This was my first time - since my dissertation - **combining audio middleware with gameplay 
programming**, making it an **exciting learning experience**.

# The Outcome & Lessons Learned

Once again, we successfully **completed the game within 48 hours**. This project further proved 
that our **team dynamic was incredibly efficient**, reinforcing our ability to **divide tasks, 
adapt quickly, and execute ideas under pressure**.

# Final Thoughts

_E.D.D.I.E._ wasn‚Äôt just another game jam entry ‚Äî it was another **validation of our teamwork and 
problem-solving skills**. It also showed me the power of **game jams as a way to improve in both 
audio and coding**.

**Try it out and see how well you can guide E.D.D.I.E. to safety!**
