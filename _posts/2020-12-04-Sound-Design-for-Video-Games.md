# Introduction

In **2020**, as part of my **Sound Design for Video Games** module, I was tasked with developing 
**sound effects, soundscapes, and music** for a **prototype game**. This module was one of the 
**final components** of my **online Bachelor (Honours) of Arts in Music Production and Sound 
Engineering course**.

# From Sound to Code

While working on this project, I was also deep into my **dissertation research**, which led me to 
**experiment with code and audio programming**. What started as a way to enhance my sound 
implementation soon became something much bigger â€” **a newfound passion for coding**.

# The Turning Point

This experience opened the door to a whole new creative world, where **sound design and 
programming** intersect. It was the first step toward what would eventually become a 
**full-fledged interest in game audio programming**, setting the foundation for my later work 
in **audio engines and interactive sound systems**.

# Final Thoughts

This project was more than just an academic requirement â€” it was the moment I realized that 
**coding and sound design could go hand in hand**. It marked the transition from **music 
production** to a broader exploration of **audio technology and interactive media**.
**This is where my journey into audio programming truly began.**
