In 2020, for my Sound Design for Video Games module, I was tasked with developing SFX, soundscapes and music for a prototype game. This module was one of the final modules in the online Bachelor (Honours) of Arts in Music Production and Sound Engineering course.

In conjunction with my dissertation project, I stepped into the world of code and Audio Programming which ultimately lead to the discovery and passion in code.
