As part of my honours dissertation, I decided to recreate the soundscapes and SFX of a cinematic video. I chose ADAM: Episode One to be this video, removed all of the audio from it without ever hearing its original sound and built my own environment of sound based on what I was feeling from the footage.
This was an incredible experience and had me thinking many times out of the box and how to keep sounds interesting to captivate the listener. From using deodorant cans for the release of the wires, to the squelching of a leather belt when the latex is torn, to the clashing of two forks for the robot's mechanical movement, it was a fantastic experience.

The other part of my honours degree project involved exploring how audio was implemented into middleware, processed and manipulated to create an immersive environment for the player.
For this, I taught myself how to use FMOD and C# in order to integrate my sounds into the Unity Game Engine. Despite the workload of both projects involving sound asset creation, composition, learning what code is from the very foundations and two new pieces of software, it was another pivotal moment in my life. This project ultimately revealed my hidden passion for coding and problem solving.
