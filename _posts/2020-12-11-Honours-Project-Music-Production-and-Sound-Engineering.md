# Introduction

For my **honours dissertation**, I wanted to **push my sound design skills past the limit** while 
exploring how **interactive audio works in games**. This project had two main parts:

1. **Recreating the soundscapes and SFX** for a cinematic video without hearing the original audio.
2. **Learning FMOD and C#** to integrate my own sounds into a game engine.

What started as an advanced sound design challenge quickly became a **turning point** in my journey, 
revealing my passion for **audio programming and problem-solving**.

# Recreating a Cinematic Soundscape

For the **first part of the project**, I chose **ADAM: Episode One** and stripped away all of its 
original audio. Without ever hearing how it sounded before, I built an entirely new 
**sonic environment** based purely on what I felt from the visuals.

This experience pushed me to **think outside the box**, using creative Foley techniques to craft 
immersive, believable sounds:

- **Deodorant cans** for the release of the wires.
- **Squelching a leather belt** to mimic latex tearing.
- **Clashing two forks together** for **robotic mechanical movement**.

Every element had to **captivate the listener** while staying true to the atmosphere of the video, 
making it one of the most rewarding sound design projects Iâ€™ve ever worked on.

# From Sound to Code â€“ Interactive Audio in Games

The second part of my **honours dissertation** focused on **how audio is implemented into 
middleware**, processed, and manipulated to create an immersive game experience.

To achieve this, I **taught myself FMOD and C#** and integrated my custom sound assets into the 
**Unity Game Engine**. This required learning:

- **How middleware like FMOD processes and controls in-game audio.**
- **The basics of C# coding**, starting from the very foundations.
- **The workflow of integrating sound assets dynamically into Unity.**
- 
Despite the workload â€” **creating sound assets, composing music, learning two new software tools, 
and writing code from scratch** â€” this project became a **pivotal moment** in my career. It 
ultimately revealed my **hidden passion for coding and problem-solving**.

# Final Thoughts

What started as an **exploration of sound design** ended up unlocking **a whole new creative 
direction** for me. This project didnâ€™t just refine my **sound design skills** â€” it laid the 
foundation for my journey into **game audio programming**.

**This was the moment I knew coding would become a huge part of my future.**
