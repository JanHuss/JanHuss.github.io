This devlog is made to log my progress in designing and building an audio engine for video games.

For some context, I have just submitted my project idea and am currently writing my proposal which will narrow down my focus even more. 
I plan on posting a blog post once a month to showcase my development process and to remind myself what I have already achieved.

I came to Abertay University to learn and understand the concepts of code, specifically audio programming and for 2 years I have been toying with the idea of building a personal audio engine. The inspiration largely came from a GDC presentation on Rockstar's RAGE Audio. At the time, I could barely code in C++ and did not know much about the difficulties an audio programmer can face. Even after understanding topics in data structures and algorithms, I was not phased by the thought that I could not build a large application. In fact, I could not be more excited.

For an honours project, I am tasked to utilise a research question and although the question was right in front of me, it took me a while to get there:

During my initial research on audio programming 4 years ago, I often came across the term "audio budget" and how developers and programmers did whatever they could to stay within that budget. Some managed to reduce file sizes, others managed to re-imagine soundbanks. Therefore, I will build an optimised engine with a focus on memory allocation and analyse its efficiency against other, more popular audio engines. By no means do I have the intension of making a "better" engine (whatever that means) than Wwise, FMOD or even RAGE Audio but I would like to understand how the basic structure and architecture works while considering the usage of memory allocation and file management.

I know that I will continue working on this project even when the honours year is complete. There are many areas I wish to explore, but I think this is already an ambitious start.
