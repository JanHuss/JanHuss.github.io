# Overview
---
This devlog was made to log my progress in designing and building an audio engine for video games.

For some context, I have just submitted my project idea and am currently writing my proposal which will narrow down the focus of the project even more. 
I plan on posting a blog post once a month to showcase my development process and to remind myself what I have already achieved.

I came to Abertay University to learn and understand the concepts of code, specifically audio programming, and for 2 years I have been toying with the idea of building a personal audio engine. The inspiration largely came from a GDC presentation on Rockstar's RAGE Audio. At the time, I could barely code in C++ and did not know much about the difficulties an audio programmer can face. Even after understanding topics in data structures and algorithms, I was not phased by the thought that I could not build such a complex and large application. In fact, I could not be more excited.

For the honours project, I was tasked to form a research question and utilise it from preventing any rail roading. The question took some time to take form however, it had been in front of me all this time:

## The Research Question
---
During my initial research on audio programming 4 years ago, I often came across the term "audio budget" and how developers and programmers did whatever they could to stay within that budget. Some managed to reduce file sizes, others managed to re-imagine soundbanks. Therefore, I will build an optimised engine with a focus on memory allocation and analyse its efficiency against other, more popular audio engines. By no means do I have the intension of attempting to build a "better" engine than Wwise, FMOD. These tools have clearly been built by teams and took time which I don't have a lot of. But I would like to understand how the basic structure and architecture of an Audio Engine works and see where this could take me. Therefore my research question is:

**_"How to design, structure and build an efficient and optimised audio engine that can keep asset usage within a given budget?"_**

# Final Thoughts

I know that I will continue working on this project even when the honours year is complete. There are many areas I wish to explore, but I think this is already an ambitious start.
