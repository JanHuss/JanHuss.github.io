# Introduction

I had the opportunity to **contribute to the development of a trigonometry module** for a 
**mathematics primer course at Abertay University**. This course is designed as a **refresher and 
reference guide** for students taking mathematics modules at the university.

# My Role in the Project

As part of this project, I:

- **Learned how to work with "My Learning Space,"** the university‚Äôs online learning platform.
- **Helped structure and explain trigonometry concepts** in a way that was clear and accessible 
to students.
- **Strengthened my own understanding of trigonometry** by breaking it down into simpler terms.

This experience reinforced how **teaching and explaining a subject deepens comprehension**, 
making it a valuable learning process for me as well.

# Final Thoughts

Being involved in this project allowed me to **contribute to an educational tool** that will help 
future students at Abertay. It was also a great opportunity to **apply technical concepts in an 
academic setting** while gaining experience in **structuring educational content**.

**A rewarding experience that combined learning with teaching!**
