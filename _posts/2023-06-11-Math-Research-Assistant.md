I was invited to help develop a module based on Trigonometry for a mathematics primer course at Abertay University. The course is designed to be a refresher and reference for students undergoing mathematics modules at Abertay University.
I got to know the functionality of the "My Learning Space" application the university uses and was able to explain trigonometry in my own words, which helped solidify my understanding.
