Into Space was a side project I made along my studies. I wanted to explore the specifics of baselines in genres such as dubstep and neurofunk, how they are written and designed. Although this project didn't meet my criteria, it was a pivotal moment in understanding the genres and therefore an important milestone in my career.
The song was produced, mixed and mastered by myself.
