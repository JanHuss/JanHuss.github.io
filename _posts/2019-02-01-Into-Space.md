# Introduction

*Into Space* was a **side project** I worked on alongside my studies, driven by a curiosity to 
explore the **specifics of bass design** in genres like **dubstep and neurofunk**. I wanted to 
understand how their **basslines are written, structured, and designed** to create the signature 
sound of these genres.

# Project Breakdown

This track was an opportunity to experiment with:

- **Sound Design** â€“ Creating complex, evolving bass textures.
- **Composition Techniques** â€“ Structuring basslines rhythmically and melodically.
- **Mixing & Mastering** â€“ Balancing aggression with clarity in a high-energy mix.

# Challenges & Key Takeaways

Although *Into Space* didnâ€™t fully meet my original expectations, it was a **pivotal moment** in 
my journey. It gave me **invaluable insight into the mechanics of bass-heavy genres**, which later 
influenced my approach to sound design and production.

# Final Thoughts

Even though this track wasn't a perfect execution of my vision, it played an essential role in 
shaping my understanding of **dubstep and neurofunk production**. It stands as an important 
milestone in my career, marking the start of deeper exploration into bass design.
