# Introduction

After discovering my passion for **coding in audio**, I made the decision to **move to Dundee** and 
study an **undergraduate computer science degree** at **Abertay University**.

While waiting to officially begin my course in **year two**, I had the opportunity to join the 
**second term of year one** in the **Computer Game Application Development (CGAD) program**. As 
part of my coursework, I was tasked with building a **2D game using SFML**, a framework prepared 
by our lecturers.

This resulted in my **first fully completed game**, a **Zelda-themed escape room**, which set the 
stage for my journey into **game development**.

# The Game ‚Äì A 2D Escape Room Adventure

For this project, I used **Zelda: Minish Cap-style sprites** to create a **top-down escape room 
game**, where the player must:
- **Explore a maze of 8 interconnected rooms.**
- **Search for a key** to unlock the front door and escape.
- **Avoid or defeat ChuChu enemies**, which **chase and damage the player on contact**.
- **Attack enemies with a sword**, clearing the way forward.
- **Experience full audio integration**, adding immersion to the gameplay.

The game followed a **classic puzzle-adventure structure**, requiring **both exploration and combat 
mechanics**.

# Final Thoughts

This project was a **huge milestone** ‚Äî it was the **first full game I ever completed**, and I 
couldn‚Äôt wait for more. It solidified my **interest in game development** and set the foundation 
for everything I would later learn at Abertay.

**This was just the beginning of my journey into game programming!**
