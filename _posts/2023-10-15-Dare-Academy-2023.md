# Introduction

For many years, **Abertay University** has hosted **Dare Academy**, a prestigious summer-long 
competition where students team up to develop a game pitch and **showcase it at EGX London**.

My teammate and I decided to take on the challenge‚Äîwith nothing but a **few animations and some 
slides**. A two-person programming team was **unheard of until that point**, and I had just 
finished my **second year**, making us the clear underdogs.

But after confidently presenting our approach, we were accepted into the **Dare Academy**, 
becoming the **only two-person team in the competition**.

# The Game ‚Äì An Eldritch Monster-Collecting RPG

Our game is an **Eldritch-inspired monster-collecting RPG**, where the protagonist **unwittingly 
unleashes a monster apocalypse** upon the world.

As a two-person team, we had to **divide roles strategically**:

- **I focused on production, audio, and coding.**
- **My teammate handled team leadership, visuals, and coding.**
- **We both worked on game design and balancing.**

Despite the challenges, our teamwork and persistence paid off. Not every day was easy, but 
those difficult moments only made us stronger.

# Showcasing at EGX London

At **EGX London**, we presented our game to players, industry professionals, and judges. 
The response was **overwhelmingly positive**, and to our amazement, we **won all of the awards up 
for grabs** ‚Äî including **Best Audio**, which now proudly sits on my desk.

I was later told that I became **the first second-year student to ever win Dare Academy** in its 
then 20-year history.

Our game also caught the attention of **VG247**, which wrote a review about it: <br>

# Final Thoughts

This project remains one of the **greatest achievements of my life so far**. It not only proved 
what my teammate and I were capable of but also opened doors to new opportunities.

I‚Äôm incredibly excited to see where this experience will take me next.
