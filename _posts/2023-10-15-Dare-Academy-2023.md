For many years, Abertay University has hosted Dare Academy over the summer. Dare is a competition in which students from all courses can form a teams and apply to get a once in a life time opportunity to develop a game pitch and showcase it at the EGX convention in London.
My friend, with whom I completed two game jams together decided to take on the challenge and applied with nothing but a few animations and some slides. Being a team of 2 programming students was apparently unheard of until this point. On top of that, I had just completed my 2nd year. But after explaining our approach with confidence and assertion, we were successful and entered the academy as the only two person team.

Our game is an Eldridge inspired monster collecting RPG in which the protagonist unwittingly unleashes the monster apocalypse into the world.

Being a team of two came of course with its challenges and so we divided up bigger roles. I took on the roles of production, audio and coding, while my team mate took on team lead, visuals and code. We both worked on the design and balancing of the game. Of course, not everyday was a walk in the park, but those were the days that made us stronger after.

At EGX we showcased the game together talked to the judges and ultimately won all of the awards that were up for grabs. I have been told that I was the first 2nd year student to win Dare Academy at its then 20 year history and one of the awards was "Best Audio" which sits beside me on my desk.

This project was one of my greatest achievements in my life so far and I am looking forward to seeing where this will take me.
