# Introduction

After winning **[Dare Academy](https://janhuss.github.io/posts/Dare-Academy-2023/)**, we decided 
to **keep the momentum going** and continue developing **Book of Abominations**. To scale up our 
efforts, we **expanded our team** by bringing in an **additional programmer and designer**, 
officially forming **Studio Catloaf**.

Development is still **ongoing**, and this post will be **updated as progress continues**.

# The Next Step ‚Äì A Playable Demo

Our current focus is on developing a **demo** to be pitched to **publishers**. This demo will 
feature:
- **25-30 minutes of gameplay**, giving a strong **vertical slice** of the full game.
- **An open-world feel**, allowing players to explore beyond the core demo experience.
- **Public availability**, meaning players will get to experience it firsthand.

This milestone will be crucial in shaping **the future of the project** and securing the support 
needed for full development.

# My Role at Studio Catloaf

At **Studio Catloaf**, my responsibilities cover multiple aspects of game development:

- **Sound Design & Composition** ‚Äì Crafting the **atmosphere and identity** of the game‚Äôs audio.
- **Audio Programming** ‚Äì Ensuring **seamless implementation** of interactive sound.
- **Production** ‚Äì Helping the team stay focused on **key priorities** for efficient development.

Every day presents **new challenges and learning opportunities**, making this project **one of 
the most exciting and rewarding experiences** so far.

# Final Thoughts

With **Book of Abominations** continuing to grow, I‚Äôm thrilled to be part of this **expanding 
journey**. From **[Dare Academy winners](https://janhuss.github.io/posts/Dare-Academy-2023/)** 
to forming **Studio Catloaf**, this experience has been both **a challenge and an adventure** 
‚Äî and we‚Äôre just getting started.

**Stay tuned for more updates as development continues and don't forget to wishlist Book of 
Abomintaions on Steam!**
