# Introduction

Following my performance at **Blue Dot Festival**, I decided to take on one of my biggest 
challenges yet â€” **releasing a full album**. The result was **DNA â€“ Data Not Available**, a 
**12-track journey** blending **chiptune** with **progressive house**, fusing nostalgic retro 
sounds with modern electronic production.

As a nod to **Deadmau5**, who has famously expressed his dislike for naming things, I followed suit 
by choosing track names that reflect that sentiment.

# The Challenge of Completing an Album

This was one of the toughest projects Iâ€™ve ever worked on, requiring:

- **Production & Sound Design** â€“ Crafting a consistent sonic identity across 12 tracks.
- **Mixing & Arrangement** â€“ Ensuring smooth transitions and a cohesive flow.
- **Creative Stamina** â€“ Pushing through writerâ€™s block and refining each track to completion.
- **Promoting the Album** â€“ Sharing my music on social media was uncharted territory, requiring 
  me to learn new ways to engage with an audience.

Despite the challenges, I **persevered** and saw it through to the end.

# Final Thoughts

*DNA â€“ Data Not Available* represents one of **the biggest milestones** in my musical journey â€” 
both as a **creative challenge** and as a **test of endurance**. Every track was a step toward refining 
my sound, and Iâ€™m proud of the final result. **Hit play and check it out above!**
