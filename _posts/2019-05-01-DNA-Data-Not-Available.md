After the Blue Dot festival, I made a decision to release an album. The concept was a 12 track album with the style of chiptune meets progressive house. The names of the sounds were a tribute to the artist Deadmau5 who has often mentioned his hatred to naming things.
This project was one of the toughest challenges to complete yet I persevered. All songs and sounds were produced and mixed by myself.
Mastering: Travis Cross
Album Art: Ben Antsy
