# Introduction

At **16 years of age**, I was given a **year-long project** to complete. While some attempted to 
build a violin but never finished, I also set myself an ambitious challenge: **building an electric 
guitar** — and to make it even more exciting, I decided to solder a **tube amplifier** to go with it.

I reached out to **guitar builder Albert Kurz**, had a **chat the same day**, and after 
confirming that the project was feasible within a year, I started working with him **the very next 
week**.

# The Process – Building the Guitar & Amplifier

The project involved:

- **Designing and constructing the electric guitar** from scratch.
- **Soldering and assembling a tube amplifier**.
- **Finishing both projects ahead of schedule** to present them to the public.

Even though I **never really played guitar**, completing this project **wasn’t about playing — it 
was about proving that with passion and effort, you can create anything.**

# Final Thoughts

This project remains a **symbolic reminder** of what can be achieved through **dedication and 
hands-on learning**. The same passion and perseverance that fueled this challenge are what I 
bring into **every project I work on today**.

**If you’re willing to put in the effort, you can build and create anything**.

# Future Update:

I have a **write-up of the presentation**, but it’s **on paper and written in German**. When I 
find time to scan it, I may include it here for reference.
