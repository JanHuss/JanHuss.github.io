# Introduction

_Sustain_ is a **3D isometric tower defense and resource management game** set on an **alien 
planet**. This project was developed as part of my **year 3 professional project module**, 
where students were tasked with forming teams to create a game based on a **prompt provided by an 
industry client**.

Our team was largely made up of **[Dare Academy 2023 finalists](https://janhuss.github.io/posts/Dare-Academy-2023/)**, 
bringing a level of **experience and collaboration** that helped us push through challenges. 
The game received **positive feedback throughout various playtesting events**.

# My Role in Development

During the development of _Sustain_, I was responsible for:

- **Programming the game in Unreal Engine** using **C++ and Blueprints**.
- **Integrating audio triggers** to enhance the game‚Äôs interactivity.
- **Helping manage version control**, ensuring smooth collaboration across the team.
- **Creating documentation** to assist team members unfamiliar with version control tools.

Working in a **larger team setting** introduced new challenges, particularly in **coordinating 
assets and managing collaborative workflows**, but it also provided an opportunity to 
**refine my skills in both programming and team communication**.

# Final Thoughts

This project was **one of the most valuable learning experiences** I‚Äôve had so far. 
Working with other **Dare Academy finalists**, we understood the **pressures of game 
development** and supported each other throughout the process.

**Sustain was an exciting challenge, and I look forward to applying these Unreal Engine skills 
to future projects!**
