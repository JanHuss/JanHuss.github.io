Sustain is a 3D isometric tower defence game and resource manager set on an alien planet. This game was developed during the professional project module in year 3. In this term, students from all computer game development courses were tasked to form groups and create a game based on a prompt provided by a client from the games industry.
The group was largely formed by Dare Academy 2023 finalists and has received a lot of positive feedback throughout various play parties.

My roles were programming heavy in which I developed certain mechanics and helped implement the communication of the music, soundscapes and SFX from the Wwise sound banks. My programming colleague and I asked the team to work within Unreal Engine as we hadn't had much prior experience with this engine. Throughout this module I learned valuable skills in Unreal, utilising C++ and Blueprints to build this game. I also experienced what it was like to work within a larger team. As most of my team mates were Dare Academy finalists, we all understood what it was like to work under a stressful environment and supported one another wherever we could.
