As I started with DJing, one of my greatest goals was to perform a set on a bigger stage. This came to be when I was invited to perform at the Blue Dot Festival in 2018.
I had a 45 minute time slot which started with a large and empty tent which was filled to its near maximum within 10 minutes of the performance.
An exhilarating feeling that cannot be conveyed in words.
