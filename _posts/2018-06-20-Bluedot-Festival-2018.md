# Introduction

When I first started DJing, one of my biggest ambitions was to perform on a **larger stage**. 
That dream became a reality in **2018**, when I was invited to **perform a 45-minute set at 
[Blue Dot Festival](https://eb.discoverthebluedot.com/profile/jp-huzzle/)**.  But what made 
this experience even more special was the journey leading up to it.

# How the Gig Came to Be

About a **month before Blue Dot Festival**, I performed a set at the **[School of Electronic 
Music](https://schoolofelectronicmusic.com/)** for the 
**[Sounds from the Other City Festival](https://soundsfromtheothercity.com/history/2018-festival/)**.
Unbeknownst to me, a **scout from [Blue Dot Festival](https://www.discoverthebluedot.com/)** 
was in the crowd that day. A week later, they reached out and asked if Iâ€™d like to perform. It was 
an unexpected but thrilling opportunity, and of course, I said yes!

# Building Up to Blue Dot Festival

In the lead-up to the festival, I had the chance to **talk about my music and DJing** on 
**[Reform Radio](https://www.reformradio.co.uk/)** with **Will Judd**. We covered topics like:

- How I got into music and DJing.
- The inspiration behind my alias, **JP Huzzle**.
- My approach to DJing and music selection.

Additionally, the **School of Electronic Music** published a **[blog post featuring a written 
interview](https://schoolofelectronicmusic.com/jp-huzzle-bluedot-festival/)**, where I shared 
insights into my background and what this opportunity meant to me.

# The Festival Experience

The set began in a **large, empty tent*, but within **10 minutes**, the space was nearly full. 
Watching the crowd **grow and respond to the music** in real-time was an **exhilarating moment** 
â€” a feeling thatâ€™s difficult to put into words.

# What Made This Set Special?

- **Track Selection** â€“ A carefully curated setlist that blended energy, atmosphere, and rhythm.
- **Crowd Engagement** â€“ Adapting the mix to the audienceâ€™s energy as more people joined.
- **Seamless Transitions** â€“ Keeping the momentum high with smooth mixing techniques.

# Media from the Event
The **[School of Electronic Music](https://schoolofelectronicmusic.com/)** captured the moment 
by creating **a short video on the day of the festival**. Check out the footage below!

# Final Thoughts

Performing at **Blue Dot Festival** was a **huge milestone** for me as **JP Huzzle**. The 
experience reinforced my passion for **live performance and electronic music**, and itâ€™s a moment 
Iâ€™ll always be proud of.
