# Introduction

"*Zombie Run*" was the first single I released after completing the **Music Composition Module** at the **Manchester MIDI School** (now the **[School of Electronic Music](https://schoolofelectronicmusic.com/)**). This project was a milestone in my journey as a music producer, as it allowed me to apply my freshly gained **composition techniques** and **sound design skills** in a real-world track.

# Project Breakdown

For this track, I focused on:

- Crafting a dynamic composition that tells a story.
- Designing unique synths and soundscapes to set the mood.
- Mixing and balancing the elements for a polished final product.

# Challenges & Lessons Learned

One of the biggest challenges was refining my **mixing workflow**. Applying EQ, compression, and spatial effects effectively was a major learning curve, but this project gave me hands-on experience in making each element sit well in the mix.

# Future Applications

The techniques I learned from *Zombie Run* have shaped how I approach music production today. From structuring a track to fine-tuning sound design, this project laid a strong foundation for my later work.

# Final Thoughts

Looking back, *Zombie Run* was more than just a releaseâ€”it was a turning point in my journey as a producer. If youâ€™re interested in hearing it, **give it a listen using the link above!**
