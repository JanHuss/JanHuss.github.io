# Introduction

*Rivals* holds a **special place in my heart**. After a long process of **trial and error**, I 
finally found an approach to **producing dubstep** that truly worked for me. Everything **fell into 
place naturally** during production, from sound design to composition.

Rivals has a special place in my heart. After a lot of trial and error, I finally grasped an approach I could work with on how to produce dubstep. Everything fell into place during production and sound design. and by the end of the project, I only needed to turn up the gain of the track as the mix was balanced to my satisfaction.
Unfortunately, this was the last big track that I released as I was starting to show an interest in sound design for video games.

# The Production Breakthrough

This track marked a turning point in my **dubstep production workflow**:

- **Sound Design** â€“ Everything clicked, and I found a method that made sound creation feel 
  intuitive.
- **Mixing & Balance** â€“ By the end of production, the mix was already in a great place â€” I only 
  needed to **turn up the gain** to finalize it.

# A Shift in Focus

Despite how much *Rivals* meant to me, it also became my **last major track release**. Around this 
time, I began developing a strong interest in **sound design for video games**, which gradually 
shifted my focus away from music production as a primary pursuit.

# Final Thoughts

*Rivals* represents **the culmination of everything I had learned in dubstep production** up to 
that point. While it marked the end of one chapter, it also paved the way for a new journey into 
**game audio and sound design**.
