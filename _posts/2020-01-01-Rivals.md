Rivals has a special place in my heart. After a lot of trial and error, I finally grasped an approach I could work with on how to produce dubstep. Everything fell into place during production and sound design. and by the end of the project, I only needed to turn up the gain of the track as the mix was balanced to my satisfaction.
Unfortunately, this was the last big track that I released as I was starting to show an interest in sound design for video games.
