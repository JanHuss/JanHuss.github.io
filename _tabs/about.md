I am an **Audio Tools Programmer** with a decade of experience in music production and sound design. 
I hold a **Bachelor Honours of Arts in Music Production and Sound Engineering**, and I am currently 
pursuing a **Bachelor Honours of Computer Science in Computer Game Applications Development**

expertise, allowing me to excel in the games industry.

I am also a co-founder of [Studio Catloaf](https://janhuss.github.io/posts/The-Founding-of-Studio-Catloaf/), where I 
worked as a producer, audio programmer, sound designer, and composer.
