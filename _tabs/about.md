I am an Audio Tools Programmer with a 10-year career in music production
and sound design. Completing a Bachelor Honours of Arts in Music Production
and Sound Engineering and a Bachelor Honours of Computer Science in
Computer Game Applications Development, I have worked hard to combine
knowledge in music and code to fill the role of an Audio Tools Programmer
in the games industry.

Currently, I am also one of the co-founders and company directors at
Studio Catloaf, where I work as a producer, audio programmer, and sound
designer and composer.
